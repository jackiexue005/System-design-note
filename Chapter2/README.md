# Chapter 2: Building Strong Systems – Availability, Scalability, and Fault Tolerance

This chapter explores key principles that help distributed systems remain dependable, responsive, and resilient, even under stress or failure:

- [**Availability vs. Reliability**](01-Availability-vs-Reliability.md) – Understand the difference between being "up" and being "consistent".
- [**Scalability & Maintainability**](02-Scalability-Maintainability.md) – Learn how systems grow with user demand and stay easy to manage.
- [**Fault Tolerance**](03-Fault-Tolerance.md) – Discover how systems survive crashes and recover gracefully.

These concepts are the foundation of designing large-scale, reliable infrastructure used by real-world systems like Google, Amazon, and Uber.

> All explanations are written to be accessible — no prior computer science background needed.
