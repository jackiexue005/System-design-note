# Chapter 0: Core Concepts Introduction

This chapter introduces three foundational concepts in distributed systems:

- [**Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**](01-Remote-procedure-calls.md) – how systems communicate across machines.
- [**Consistency Models**](02-Consistency-Models.md) – how data stays in sync (or doesn’t).
- [**Failure Models**](03-Failure-models.md) – how systems can fail, and what we can do about it.
- [**Availability vs. Reliability**](04-Availability-vs-Reliability.md) – Understand the difference between being "up" and being "consistent".
- [**Scalability & Maintainability**](05-Scalability-Maintainability.md) – Learn how systems grow with user demand and stay easy to manage.
- [**Fault Tolerance**](06-Fault-Tolerance.md) – Discover how systems survive crashes and recover gracefully.
- [**System Resource Estimation**](07-System-Resource-Estimation.md) - Explain **back-of-the-envelope calculations (BOTECs)** and other metrics to evaluate costs.

Each section includes simple explanations and examples to build intuition.
