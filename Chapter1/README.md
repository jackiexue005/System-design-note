# Chapter 1: Communication, Consistency, and Failure in Distributed Systems

This chapter introduces three foundational concepts in distributed systems:

- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)** – how systems communicate across machines.
- **Consistency Models** – how data stays in sync (or doesn’t).
- **Failure Models** – how systems can fail, and what we can do about it.

Each section includes simple explanations and examples to build intuition.
