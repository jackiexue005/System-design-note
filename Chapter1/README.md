# Chapter 1: Communication, Consistency, and Failure in Distributed Systems

This chapter introduces three foundational concepts in distributed systems:

- [**Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**](01-Remote-procedure-calls.md) – how systems communicate across machines.
- [**Consistency Models**](02-Consistency-Models.md) – how data stays in sync (or doesn’t).
- [**Failure Models**](03-Failure-models.md) – how systems can fail, and what we can do about it.

Each section includes simple explanations and examples to build intuition.
